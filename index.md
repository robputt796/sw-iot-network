# SouthWest Internet of Things Network Project

## Revolutionising the Use of Smart Tech in the Southwest

SWIN enables Low Power devices to use long-range gateways to connect to a decentralised network to exchange data with applications. These Low Powered devices can run on a simple small battery for years and operate on a free part of the network.

This means that multiple industries can take advantage of its transformational potential for free.
