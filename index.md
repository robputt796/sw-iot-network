# SouthWest Internet of Things Network Project

## Revolutionising the Use of Smart Tech in the Southwest

SWIN will enable Low Power devices to use long-range gateways to connect to a decentralised network to exchange data with applications. These Low Powered devices can run on a simple small battery for years and operate on a free part of the network.

We are looking to work with interested partners to roll out this network. It will be owned, operated by and work for the Southwest.
